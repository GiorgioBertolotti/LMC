# LMC Project

This LMC (Little Man Computer) project was developed by **Giorgio Bertolotti**, **Davide Cologni** and **Davide Cestari** for an university assignment.

The details of the two implementations of the project are in the READMEs of *Lisp* and *Prolog* folders.

The request of the assignment can be found in the file *Request.pdf* in Italian language.
